# :balloon: Papers to Read

This repository contains a curated list of research papers that either I already read 
or I plan to read. Additionally, some of them come along with a personal repository I created so 
as to have a better understanding of the papers, explaining complex ideas with my own words, and 
simplifying hard-to-understand concepts. Also, some of those contain an implementation in either
TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, MXNet or JAX.

:warning: __Disclaimer__. This is a personal repository, so what may be useful or easy to understand to me
may be complex to you, so don't take the contents listed here as a must-follow guide. This
is just the way I share what I usually do while reading/implementing research papers.

:man_teacher: __Credits__. Obviosuly the credits go to the original authors of the papers, but I would like
also to thank [Ross Wightman](https://github.com/rwightman), [Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains), and 
[Yannic Kilcher](https://youtube.com/c/yannickilcher) for the inspiration to start sharing how do I read and 
implement ML/DL research papers. Also as a personal recommendation go check their socials, as all of 
them create awesome content that you should keep an eye on if interested in ML/DL.

__TL;DR__ In Residual Learning the layers are reformulated as learning residual functions with
reference to the layer inputs. These networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy
from considerably increased depth. Along this repository not just an explanation is provided
but also the implementation of the ResNet architecture written in PyTorch, MXNet and JAX. 
Additionally, here you will also find the ResNet20 trained with CIFAR10, as proposed by the
authors; which is the smallest ResNet described in the original paper.
